Hello,

In this repository I have gathered the "bigger" projects I had the opportunity to work on during my studies at Fontys.

Design is the first website I created together with another teammate, using HTML,CSS,PHP and JavaScript, a website for an animal shelter.

SimpleTraffic is a traffic simulation in C#, created in a team of 5 which I was a part of.

WEB2 is a website created in angular

philips-proftaak is the iOS tablet application, as an assignment from Philips Signify, to be used by their fish farmer users to control lights provided by the company. Currently there's a more simple solution, but some users requested more control over the brightness adjustment. 

web3 is also a website, but it is created using laravel.

wilddreams is a game in Unity, a coop 2 player local "escape room" game. the two players have to work together and help eachother in order to escape from a farm.
